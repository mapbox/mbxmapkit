CONTRIBUTING
------------

If you have a usage question, please email help-at-mapbox.com. 

If you want to contribute code: 

1. Please familiarize yourself with work in [`mapbox-gl-cocoa`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-cocoa), which will eventually be the successor to this codebase. We are aiming there for a MapKit-identical API, like this project but without using MapKit at all. 

1. Fork and submit a pull request against the `master` branch so that we can review, discuss, and possibly integrate your code.
